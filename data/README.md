This directory holds the raw data for this project. 'n3.vcf.gz' is a gzipped vcf containing the unfiltered SNP dataset called using [Stacks](https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/) which contains 131,801 SNPs shared among 31 individual samples, with 36.21% overall missing data. 'filtered.vcf.gz' is gzipped vcf file containing the filtered SNP dataset of 28 samples and 17,204 SNPs, with 3.29% overall missing data, with no individual sample missing > 25% of called SNP genotypes. 'unlinked.filtered.vcf.gz' is a gzipped vcf file containing the filtered, unlinked SNP dataset of 28 samples, and 10,586 SNPs with 3.39% overall missing data, and one SNP per RAD locus. The filtered vcf was used as input for most population genetic analyses, while the filtered, unlinked dataset was used as input for most tree building analyses.
